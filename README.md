## Project Overview
deCipher is a project dedicated to developing machine learning models for detecting code obfuscation in software binaries. Code obfuscation is a technique used to make code more difficult to understand and reverse-engineer, often employed to protect intellectual property or conceal malicious activities. Detecting obfuscation is crucial for software security, aiding in the identification of potentially harmful code and ensuring the integrity of software applications.

## Objectives
Our primary objectives are:
- To create robust machine learning models that can accurately distinguish between obfuscated and non-obfuscated code.
- To analyze the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in detecting obfuscation.
- To provide insights into the patterns and characteristics of obfuscated code that can be leveraged for more effective detection.

## Methodology
We approach this problem by:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a diverse dataset of obfuscated and non-obfuscated code samples.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Analyzing the code samples to extract relevant features that can be used for model training.
3. **Model Development**: Implementing various machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, to classify the code samples.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Current Progress
- We have collected and processed a significant amount of data, comprising both obfuscated and non-obfuscated code samples.
- Initial models have been developed and are undergoing testing and refinement.
- Preliminary results indicate promising accuracy in detecting obfuscation, with ongoing efforts to further improve model performance.

## Future Directions
As we continue to develop and refine our models, we aim to:
- Expand our dataset to include a wider variety of obfuscation techniques.
- Experiment with advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms to enhance detection accuracy.
- Explore the integration of our models into real-time detection systems for practical application in software development and security.
